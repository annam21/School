# Simulations

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Sec 1.8 Problem 12

```{r}
ppl <- c(rep(1, 2), rep(0, 33) )
nsim <- 1000000

out <- rep(NA, nsim)
for(i in 1:nsim){
  # Select 1 team
  team1 <- sample(ppl, 10)
  
  # Are both people on that team or the other team? 
  out[i] <- sum(team1) %in% c(0,2)
}

# Estimated probability
sum(out)/length(out)
```
Check that this answer is similar to the calculated probability

```{r}
(choose(33, 23) + choose(33, 8))/choose(35, 10)
```
