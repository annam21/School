res1 <- lm(P8 ~ P9, data = ptarm)
res2 <- lm(P8 ~ P9 + Retrix, data = ptarm)
res3 <- lm(P8 ~ Sex + Site + Sex*Site, data = ptarm)

# Pick res2 because it has the lowest AIC value. Do the data uphold the assumptions? 
plot(res2)
# first assumption: residuals are identically distributed
#   residuals vs. fitted: 
#    data appear to have low variance at small values of y 
#    and higher variance at larger values of y, but in general they are evenly
#    distributed around the line y = 0
# assumption: residuals are normally distributed
#   normal Q-Q
#    data appear to be normal for the mid to high values of the theoretical quantiles but
#    non-normal for low values of the theoretical quantiles
# scale-location
#    the line is curved slightly in the middle, which shows that the 
#    standardized residuals are slightly lower for mid values of y than they are for
#    low or high values of y, but in general fit is okay.
# residuals vs. leverage
#    the line is slightly curved outside the giant cloud of points, which shows that a few 
#    data points are having more leverage than the cloud of points. However, no single point 
#    seems to be driving the slope results.

res5 <- lm(P8 ~ Retrix + Sex + Site, data = ptarm)
summary(res5)
# Interpret the results
# Multiple R-squared shows that this model explains 31% of the variance observed in the data.
# The p-value for the F-statistic shows that it is unlikely to observe these data if 
#     these covariates do not have a significant effect overall. 
# The p-values for each covariate show that it is unlikely to observe these data if these 
#    covariates do not have a significant effect on P8
# The estimates for Retrix and SiteKluane are negative, which shows that 
#    birds with longer Retrices have shorter P8 than birds with short Retrices and
#    birds at Kluane have shorter P8 than birds at Chilkat
# The estimate for SexMale is positive, which shoes that 
#    male birds have longer P8 than female birds
# The covariates are not scaled and centered, so we cannot interpret the relative magnitude
#    of the relationship for each one. If they were scaled and centered, I would compare
#    the Estimate value. 
# Does the model fit?
plot(res5)
# residuals vs. fitted
#   the line is curved which indicates the fit is not great. The points on the left and right
#   side of the fitted values are all below the line y=0
# normal Q-Q
#   this looks pretty good. The points below theoretical quantile -1 do not fall on the 
#   line, but it is not as bad as other Q-Q plots we have seen
# residuals vs. leverage
#   It appears that the points outside the cloud of points are driving the slope
#   quite a bit (because the line is not straight) but no points are outside the 
#   Cook's distance, so the fit may be okay. 
# In general, fit doesn't appear great, but seems okay.
